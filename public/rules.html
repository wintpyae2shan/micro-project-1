                    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
                    <p>Footballâ€™s rules are straightforward, yet they provide a deep foundation
                        for complex tactics and strategies. Each match is played over two
                        45-minute halves, with a brief break in between. Players must maneuver
                        the ball around the field using only their feet, with the occasional use
                        of the head or chest to control it.</p>
                    <p>Physical contact is allowed but regulated to prevent injuries. Key rules
                        include the offside rule, which prevents unfair positioning, and the
                        system of yellow and red cards, which penalize fouls and misconduct.
                        These rules, managed by referees, ensure fair play while adding layers of excitement to the
                        game.</p>
