                    <h2>The Origin</h2>
                    <p>The origins of football trace back thousands of years to ancient civilizations, where various cultures played games involving a ball.
                        Early forms of the sport can be found in ancient China, where a game called “Cuju” involved kicking a leather ball through a small
                        opening. Similarly, in ancient Greece and Rome, games resembling football were popular for physical training and competition. However,
                        the roots of modern football are most strongly tied to medieval England, where villagers played a chaotic, often violent game known as
                        "mob football" with few rules and large teams.It wasn’t until the 19th century that the game began to formalize.</p>

                    <h2>The Start of Modern Football</h2>
                    <p>In 1863, the Football Association (FA) was established in England, creating the first standardized rules of the game, which laid the foundation for
                        modern football. These early regulations helped the game evolve into a structured sport, fostering the growth of clubs, leagues, and eventually,
                        international competitions, leading to the universally loved game of football we know today.</p>
